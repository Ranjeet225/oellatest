                        <h5>Tips to Crack the Interview</h5>
                        <p>Now you know what sorts of questions are asked during a visa interview. It is the time to collect some well-aimed </p>
                        <h5>Keep All Your Documents Handy</h5>
                        <p>The most important thing while you plan your studies abroad is to keep all the official documents handy. Some mandatory documents are Visa application form, university acceptance letter, income certificate. Collect and arrange all the mandatory documents as detailed and bring along enough evidence to the interview to get the visa. Check them twice before going for the interview.</p>
                        <h5>Polish Your Language</h5>
                        <p>If you had English as second language of study, then work on your English proficiency skill. This will help you to communicate with the interviewer properly. It will also be beneficial during your stay in the country. Practice reading English newspapers, magazines, novels, blogs as much as possible. Watch English movies, TV shows, listen to songs and try to communicate in English in your daily life.</p>
                        <h5>Stay Positive and Be Attentive</h5>
                        <p>Your gesture and attitude lay the foundation for your interview. It is important to stay positive, responsive, and attentive during the interview. Listen to the questions carefully, give complete attention to the interviewer or the translator. Think before you answer and try to keep your answers concise and to the point. Time matters a lot and all the consular officers are under time pressure and want to conduct quick interviews. Hence, the first few minutes of the interview are the decisive ones. Try to give a good initial impression.</p>
                        <h5>Know Your Program and Career Plans</h5>
                        <p>How can you expect to get a student visa if you know nothing about your study program? Prepare the reason why you have decided to continue your studies abroad. It is important to convince the consular about your study plan and you need to explain how it will shape your career in your home country.</p>
                        <h5>Talk About Family or Dependent at Home</h5>
                        <p>In case you are married, and your spouse or children are not coming along with you, you must address this condition during the interview. You will be required to explain how they will manage their lives in your absence, especially if you are the primary income generator of the family. In any case, the consular gets the impression that they will need your support financially by remitting money from abroad, there are chances that your visa application will get denied. If there are chances that your family will join you later make sure they apply for the visa at the same post where you had applied.</p>

                         <h5>Speak for Yourself</h5>
                        <p>Attend the interview all by yourself. Do not bring your parents with you. It will give an impression that you are not able to speak for yourself. You need to make them believe that you are capable enough to live on your own in another country. If any family member assists you to the interview tell them to wait in the waiting room.</p>

                         <h5>Employment or Study</h5>
                        <p>BE sure your purpose to go abroad should be to study and not work. Do not plan to work during or after completing the program. However, work while study on-campus or off-campus is not counted as it is meant to support and complete the education with the consent of the university. Make it very clear during the interview that you plan to return home once you complete the program.</p>
