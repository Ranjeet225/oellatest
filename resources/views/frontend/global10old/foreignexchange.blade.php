                        OEL provide a currency's value exchange to another country's currency, such as the U.S. dollar, or even to a basket of currencies.<br>
                        Foreign exchange, or forex, is the conversion of one country's currency into another.<br>
                            In a free economy, a country's currency is valued according to the laws of supply and demand.<br>
                            The economic factors include a government's economic policies, trade balances, inflation, and economic growth outlook.<br>
                            Political conditions also exert a significant impact on the forex rate, as events such as political instability and political conflicts may negatively affect the strength of a currency. The psychology of forex market participants can also influence exchange rates.<br>
                        Many factors can potentially influence the market forces behind foreign exchange rates. The factors include various economic, political, and even psychological conditions.
